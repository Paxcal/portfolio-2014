<h2 class="center">The Concept</h2>
<p class="center">
	The Harry Potter series is very special to many millennials who grew up with the books. Each novel is more complex than the last, and riddled with fantasticly deep character development and lessons. The book set becomes a nostalgic relic &mdash; a precious commodity to those who find so much significance in it. <br><br>
	With this redesign, I wanted to honor the Harry Potter series, appealing to those now-grown-up millenials, using clean geometric lines and symbols to represent each addition to the series. As the books progress, and the wizarding world falls further and further into ruin, so do the covers. </p>
