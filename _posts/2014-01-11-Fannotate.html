	<h3>The Team:</h3>

		<li><p><span>Olivia Brown</span> did the majority of the design and the logo</p></li>
		<li><p><span>Cristina Keane</span> designed the marketing site and helped in the ideation</li>
		<li></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>We went out in the wild -- we watched human behavior, took notes, and drew conclusions. We surveryed over 100 people ages 18-52 to learn about their music and entertainment prefernces, and a few conclusions were drawn:</p>
	<div class="statistic">
		<h2>73%</h2>
		<p>Listened to music for over 7 hours a week</p>
	</div>
	<div class="statistic">
		<h2>61%</h2>
		<p>Also used social media for at least that long.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="statistic">
		<h2>92%</h2>
		<p>Listen to music or audio on their phones during their commute</p>
	</div>
