<h2>A Very Conceptual Idea</h2>
<p class="push-bottom"> The assignment for this project was to change an existing behavior for a client... and we were encouraged to use methods and things that may not exist just yet. By turning to the children, teaching them about the benefits of fruit at a young age, you can change habits when they are most pliable.
<br><br>
Because of the required phone projector, this app isn't exactly possible right now, BUT -- maybe some day in the future it will be. We already are beginning to see phones with projectors, so why not?
<br><br>
I created this app as an extension of the Edible Rebranding.<br>

<h2 class="center">Wireframes & Storyboards</h2>
<p class="center">Since this was mostly filmed at a grocery store (and with a 5-year-old!), I realy had to time and plan out every scene. I was worried about getting kicked out of the store and dealing with an annoyed child. I only ended up returning to Whole Foods twice, and they were really nice about me filming. I didn't bring a tripod in order to not capture attention.</p>

<h2>Animating the Prototype</h2>
<p> I love design, and I love coding, and I feel like the sweet spot between design and coding is in the interactions. All of the animation on the phone prototypes was created using CSS and SVG graphics, like this example below:</p>
<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="nhEFp" data-user="unax3" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/unax3/pen/nhEFp'>Jeff the Bug in Flight Mode</a> by Una Kravets (<a href='http://codepen.io/unax3'>@unax3</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a></p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<br><br><br><br>
<h2>Faking it with Code</h2>
<p>Every phone interaction from the video was coded as a separate web page to prototype the final app (for a more natural interaction when filming). At first, I thought: great! CSS animations will make this enjoyable and easy. It will all be good. Well, it turns out that CSS animations run terribly on mobile devices. And I needed one of those for filming. Often the phone being used in the video would freeze, and we had to time some of the scenes pretty well. It also left my home screen filled with little icons.</p>

<blockquote class="push">I designed for both the iPhone4s and iPhone5. You can interact with these screens to trigger animations timed to the music of the final video. </blockquote>

<h2>It Takes a City</h2>
<p>I wanted this app to look as realistic as possible, and the favor list I called in for this is... HUGE. Let me take a moment to thank them all. Thank you Javier Rios for letting me borrow your sisters mini-projector. Mariesa Dale and her adorable son, Kayden, for being a wonderful actors. Alex Lubinsky for doing the apple voiceover and bringing me chocolate and wine to the filming of the table scene when I was stressing out about it. Ally Palanzi for being my hand model and letting me use her iPhone 5 to test screens on.</p>
