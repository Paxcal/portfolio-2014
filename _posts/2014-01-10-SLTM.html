	<h2>Una Goes to Europe</h2>
	<p>I wanted a way to really commemorate my time abroad, and combine all of the skills I learned while in art school in Florence. I ended up merging three classes: creative writing, serigraphy (screen printing), and book binding into one little package, <span>titled after my personal motto: Sleep Less & Travel More.</span>
	<br><br>

	The set features two books: One containing memoirs and photographs, the other containing physical trinkets, along with two screen prints.
	<br><br>

	From writings to photography to screen prints and picking out Italian decorative paper, this project really did have many facets to it. It was a chance to get my hands dirty (<span> I LOVE crafting things!</span>) and be fully immersed in the creation of my little memory book.</p>

<blockquote>The book is filled with vignettes, poems, and letters about places I traveled, paired with photographs I took there.</blockquote>

		<h2 >Getting My Hands Dirty</h2>
		<p>Serigraphy was a class I ended up <span>loving</span> and really embracing. I learned a lot about registration, color separation, paper quality, and ink making. I got my hands dirty making the silk screens for this project (somehow managed keep the final prints clean!), printing on both etching paper and book cloth.</p>

		<h2>Beyond a Perfect Stitch</h2>
		<p>
			My favorite take away from my abroad experience was what I learned in my book arts class. From stitching open-spine books to gluing hardcovers, I learned so much and greatly improved my craft. Sleep Less & Travel More became my final creation, combining hard cover binds to printed-on book cloth covering a double-fold open spine.

	<h2>A Wonderful Adventure</h2>
	<p>
		I kept a blog when I went abroad, but also began to write about my spaces and experiences in a more creative manner. I wrote about very specific moments and impressions from cities from Barcelona to Budapest.
		<br><br>
		I also created a companion book full of tickets, business cards, and brochures from places I adored.</p>
