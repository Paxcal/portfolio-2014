<h2>When You Tell College Kids to Make "Anything"</h2>
<h3>The Team:</h3>
<p>
	<span>Jo-Yee Pang</span>: User Experience Design<br>
	<span>Eli VanAlsburg</span>: Interface Design, Illustration<br>
	<span>Erica Bond</span>: Project Management<br>
</p><br>
<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<p>Select what spirits, liquors, or mixers you have available and would like to use. Then, the available recipe list filters down to fit your selected parameters and you can click on different recipes to learn how to make them. If you're indecisive like me, you can simply shake your mobile device, and Proofessor will flip to a random recipe for you.</p>
<blockquote class="push">We wanted to create <span>something we could use</span> &mdash; something tangible that we could share with others.</blockquote>

<h2>Building with Craft</h2>
<p>Craft is a beautiful, beautiful custom CMS.</p>

<h2>It's the Little Things</h2>

<h2>JS Intensive</h2>
<pre class="half-l"><code>
	window.PROOF || (PROOF = {}); //define a namespace (only ONCE) -- I used PROOF for Proofessor
	(function($, window, document, undefined) {
	  var _common = PROOF.common = { //this is your js object
	    init: function() {
	    this.setVars();
	    this.bindEvents();
	  },
	  setVars: function() {
	    // set all variables here
	    this.helloString = "hello" ; // also _common.helloString
	  },
	  bindEvents: function() {
	    // set event listeners for your functions here
	  },
	  // the rest of your functions go here
	  _common.init(); // don't forget to init!
	})(jQuery, window, document);
</code></pre>

<h2>Defending Simplicity</h2>
<blockquote class="center push">As a front end developers, we often want to say "yes" to everything, but knowing when a task is too expensive (<span>saying 'no'</span>) is an important skill to have.</blockquote>

<h2>A Team Effort</h2>

<h2>Go Ahead, Try it Yourself</h2>
