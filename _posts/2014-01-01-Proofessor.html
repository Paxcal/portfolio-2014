<h2>When You Tell College Kids to Make "Anything"</h2>
<h3>The Team:</h3>
<p>
	<span>Jo-Yee Pang</span>: User Experience Design<br>
	<span>Eli VanAlsburg</span>: Interface Design, Illustration<br>
	<span>Erica Bond</span>: Project Management<br>
	<span>Jatin Sharma</span>: Marketing Strategy<br>
</p><br>
<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<p>Select what spirits, liquors, or mixers you have available and would like to use. Then, the available recipe list filters down to fit your selected parameters and you can click on different recipes to learn how to make them. If you're indecisive like me, you can simply shake your mobile device, and Proofessor will flip to a random recipe for you.</p>

<blockquote class="narrow-quote push">We wanted to create <span>something we could use</span> &mdash; something tangible that we could share with others.</blockquote>

<h2 class="center">Building with Craft</h2>
	<p class="center">Craft is a beautiful, brand new custom content management system, created by Expression Engine developers <span>Pixel and Tonic</span>. Version 1 was released just a few weeks before Proofessor was conceptualized. It lets you create completely customized fields, pages, and forms for clients to have a visual back-end to update their website through, while using <span>Twig</span> as a templating engine to access this data.
	<br><br>
	Using Craft enabled the leanest possible approach to building this very content-driven project. After the system was set up, the project manager (Erica) and marketing intern (Jatin) spent time inputting recipes, icons, and fun facts, while the designer (Eli) and I continued to work on the animations and design.</p><br><br><br><br>

<h2>It's the Little Things</h2>
<p>I am definitely a strong believer that the nuances of a project are what make it. I made sure to include touches (in the form of CSS animations) to just add that little bit of sparkle. The logo moustache wiggles a little on hover, and the _____. 

<br><br>
But not all of the animations planned actually made it into the production code. Originally I worked on a function to make the recipe count tally up and down --------- and the bottle drain --------- saying no section ------------ </p>

<h2>JS Intensive</h2>
<pre class="half-l"><code>
	window.PROOF || (PROOF = {}); //define a namespace (only ONCE) -- I used PROOF for Proofessor
	(function($, window, document, undefined) {
	  var _common = PROOF.common = { //this is your js object
	    init: function() {
	    this.setVars();
	    this.bindEvents();
	  },
	  setVars: function() {
	    // set all variables here
	    this.helloString = "hello" ; // also _common.helloString
	  },
	  bindEvents: function() {
	    // set event listeners for your functions here
	  },
	  // the rest of your functions go here
	  _common.init(); // don't forget to init!
	})(jQuery, window, document);
</code></pre>

<h2>Defending Simplicity</h2>
<blockquote class="center push">As a front end developers, we often want to say "yes" to everything, but knowing when a task is too expensive (<span>saying 'no'</span>) is an important skill to have.</blockquote>
