<h2>When You Tell College Kids to Make "Anything"</h2>
<h3>The Team:</h3>
<p>
	<span>Jo-Yee Pang</span>: User Experience Design<br>
	<span>Eli VanAlsburg</span>: Interface Design, Illustration<br>
	<span>Erica Bond</span>: Project Management<br>
	<span>Jatin Sharma</span>: Marketing Strategy<br>
</p><br>
<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<p class="max-40">Select what spirits, liquors, or mixers you have available and would like to use. Then, the available recipe list filters down to fit your selected parameters and you can click on different recipes to learn how to make them. If you're indecisive like me, you can simply shake your mobile device, and Proofessor will flip to a random recipe for you.</p>

<h2 class="center">Building with Craft</h2>
	<p class="center">Craft is a beautiful, brand new custom content management system, created by Expression Engine developers <span>Pixel and Tonic</span>. Version 1 was released just a few weeks before Proofessor was conceptualized. It lets you create completely customized fields, pages, and forms for clients to have a visual back-end to update their website through, while using <span>Twig</span> as a templating engine to access this data. I wrote about the CMS on my blog <a href="http://blog.unakravets.com/post/53928357108/starting-to-craft">here</a> and about how to set it up on a Mac <a href="http://blog.unakravets.com/post/58150139083/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-setting-up-craft-on-mac">here</a>.
	<br><br>
	Using Craft enabled the leanest possible approach to building this very content-driven project. After the system was set up, the project manager (Erica) and marketing intern (Jatin) spent time inputting recipes, icons, and fun facts, while the designer (Eli) and I continued to work on the animations and design.</p><br><br><br><br>

<h2>It's the Little Things</h2>
<p>I am definitely a strong believer that the nuances of a project are what make it. I made sure to include touches (in the form of CSS animations) to just add that little bit of sparkle. The logo mustache wiggles a little on hover, and the bottles flip and gray out when selected (they flip back when "reset"). 

<br><br>
But not all of the animations planned actually made it into the production code. Originally I worked on a function to make the recipe count tally up and down upon changes, and the bottles to drain when selected, however I learned to let go of these fun quirks. I was taught to be a <span>defender of simplicity</span> and understand when to say no.</p>

<blockquote class="center push js-invert">As a front end developers, we often want to say "yes" to everything, but knowing when a task is too expensive <span>(when to say 'no')</span> is an important skill to have.</blockquote>

	<h2>The Proofessor Playground</h2>
	<p class="clear-max">
		I learned SO much about Javascript code from this project, and really had a chance to "play around" with different functions. From playing with shaking (left) to reading the recipe count, it was important to be stay organized. The code was re-factored over and over, but turned out to be something I was very proud of: clean, object-oriented, and name spaced. I organized it mostly based on this model:
	</p>
<br>
<br>

<pre><code>window.PROOF || (PROOF = {}); //define a namespace (only ONCE) -- I used PROOF for Proofessor
(function($, window, document, undefined) {
  var _common = PROOF.common = { //this is your js object
    init: function() {
    this.setVars();
    this.bindEvents();
  },
  setVars: function() {
    // set all variables here
    this.helloString = "hello" ; // also _common.helloString
  },
  bindEvents: function() {
    // set event listeners for your functions here
  },
  // the rest of your functions go here
  _common.init(); // don't forget to init!
})(jQuery, window, document);
</code></pre>

	Collaboration was key. There was a lot of talk between teams, and a lot of co-working that brought Proofessor to life.
