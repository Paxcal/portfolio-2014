	<h2>We Turned to People</h2>
	<p>We went out in the wild -- we watched human behavior, took notes, and drew conclusions. We surveryed over 100 people ages 18-52 to learn about their music and entertainment prefernces, and a few conclusions were drawn:</p>
	<div class="statistic">
		<h2>73%</h2>
		<p>Listened to music for over 7 hours a week</p>
	</div>
	<div class="statistic">
		<h2>61%</h2>
		<p>Also used social media for at least that long.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="statistic">
		<h2>92%</h2>
		<p>Listen to music or audio on their phones during their commute</p>
	</div>

<h2>Wireframe, Re-Wireframe</h2>
<p>It took a long time and several iterations based on user testing feedback, to solidify the outline of this design. While consulting with the team about user experience, I began the process of prototyping the app’s general interactions such as screen switching and menu flyouts.
